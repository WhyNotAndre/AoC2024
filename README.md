# 🎄 Python Solutions to Advent of Code 2024 - The "I Swear I Know What I'm Doing" Edition

## Description
Welcome to my obscure internet corner where I attempt to solve Advent of Code puzzles using Python! Expect a delightful mix of questionable coding practices and existential dread as I navigate through these challenges. 

## About Me
Just so you know about my questionable career choices, I'm a VBA developer who’s been trying to learn Python for over three years now, with plenty of breaks and abandoned attempts along the way. 
Despite my ongoing struggle with the language, I've somehow managed to produce some decent Python code for my job (at least by my own low standards). 
In 2023, I tackled nearly half of the puzzles with nothing but Excel/VBA (and eventually gave up)
This year, I'm diving headfirst into Python, armed with nothing but a half-baked understanding and a lot of caffeine. ☕️😅

## What to Expect
- Daily solutions that may or may not work (spoiler: they probably won't). 🤷‍♂️
- Sporadic comments that reflect my inner turmoil 😩💔 and confusion. 🤔💭🌀
- Occasional bursts of brilliance that I will definitely forget by the next day. 💡🤦‍♂️
- A collection of "solutions" that are more like desperate cries for help than actual code. 😬

## Progress Updates
- Each day will feature my attempts, failures, and the occasional success, all documented with the grace of a toddler learning to walk. 🚶‍♂️💨
- Expect to see me questioning my life choices and wondering why I thought this was a good idea. 😵‍💫

## Join Me
If you're also struggling through Advent of Code or just want to witness my coding journey filled with awkward moments and dubious decisions, feel free to follow along! 🎉

## Disclaimer
I promise my production code is way better than this. Please don't judge me too harshly; I'm just here to learn and have a bit of fun (and maybe cry a little). 😭

So, grab your favorite beverage, and let’s see how many days I can survive this! 🥤🎊 (I bet 10 at max)
